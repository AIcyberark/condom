# Structure of the branches

If you want to contribute to this mess at this stage. You know how to find me.

The real source code is under the `source` branch. The `master` branch is reserved to publish a clean compiled version. This arrangement is due to the nature of github actions which requires a built version to be checked in. The maintainer of the project (Alice) wishes to have a clean separation between compiled codes and the source code, though many others have made a different choice.
